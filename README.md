# Experiment with Kademlia with GPT4

Summary of my questions:

Q1: "Implement the kademlia find_node routine in rust."

Q2: "Make this a lib and create a FindNodeTrait so we can mock the network and pass the trait to `Kademlia::new` instead of `send_find_node_request`."

Q3: "async methods in traits isn't supported in stable, what are our choices?"

Q4: "If I understand correctly we have a p2p network with one Node with an id of 1 and our test passes because when we search for a node with id 12345 it's not found, which is expected by the test. Create a second test where node with the id 12345 is found."

Q5: "This doesn't work because `kademlia` doesn't know any Nodes. I.e. `kademlia.buckets` is empty so in `find_node` hence the serch for closest_nodes fails. So there needs to be a set of `Kademlia` and then we need a way for them to discover each other. I'm thinking we setup a Lazy initialized HashMap of Kademlia instances and then, somehow, have then them discover some subset of their neighbors. Your thoughts?"

A: "You're right, I apologize for the oversight. The current implementation will not work because kademlia doesn't have any nodes in its buckets. ..."

Me: I went head and added TEST_NODES which is a HashMap<u64, Node>.

Q6: "So now there are a bunch of nodes in the KademlaiNetwork and they can be found if/when find_node_request is called, but I don't see any of those nodes filling there buckets with neighbors. Did I miss something?"

A: "You're right, my previous response did not address the issue of filling the Kademlia instances' buckets with neighbors. To achieve that, let's add a method to the KademliaNetwork struct that connects the instances with a random set of neighbors. ... Keep in mind that this setup and neighbor assignment method is more suitable for testing purposes. In a real-world scenario, nodes would join the network and discover their neighbors through the Kademlia protocol."

Q7: "Let's add the join/discover Kademlia protocol?"

A: "
To add the join/discover Kademlia protocol, we will implement a join method for the Kademlia struct, which will be used to join an existing network by contacting a bootstrap node. The bootstrap node is an existing node in the network used as an initial point of contact for new nodes joining the network.

Update the Kademlia struct in lib.rs to add the join method to its `impl`:

```rust
    pub async fn join(&mut self, bootstrap_node: Node) -> Result<(), ()> {
        let target = self.node.id;

        // Perform an initial find_node request on the bootstrap node
        let closest_nodes = self.find_node_impl.find_node_request(&bootstrap_node, target).await?;

        // Update the bucket with the bootstrap node
        self.update_bucket(bootstrap_node).await;

        // Update the bucket with the nodes found in the initial find_node request
        for node in closest_nodes {
            self.update_bucket(node).await;
        }

        Ok(())
    }
```

And then, in a test use `join` like so to iniitalize buckets:

```rust
    // Have nodes join the network using the first node as the bootstrap node
    let bootstrap_node = network.lock().unwrap().instances[0].node.clone();
    for instance in &mut network.lock().unwrap().instances[1..] {
        instance.join(bootstrap_node.clone())).unwrap();
    }
```
